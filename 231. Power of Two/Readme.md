位运算的解释
If n is the power of two:

    n = 2 ^ 0 = 1 = 0b0000...00000001, and (n - 1) = 0 = 0b0000...0000.
    n = 2 ^ 1 = 2 = 0b0000...00000010, and (n - 1) = 1 = 0b0000...0001.
    n = 2 ^ 2 = 4 = 0b0000...00000100, and (n - 1) = 3 = 0b0000...0011.
    n = 2 ^ 3 = 8 = 0b0000...00001000, and (n - 1) = 7 = 0b0000...0111.

we have n & (n-1) == 0b0000...0000 == 0

Otherwise, n & (n-1) != 0.

时间复杂度为 $O(1)$
